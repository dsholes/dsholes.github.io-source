Notes:
What else to put on website?
1. Recording an album with old smart phones...
    1. Download recorder app if one isn't pre-installed
    2. Change settings to highest quality (wav, sampling rate, etc)
    3. Cell phone placement and checking for peaking.
    4. "Clap" or snare hits to match up tracks
        1. Can also use python code to help (link to Getting started
            with Music Processing in Python)
    5. Mix everything in Reaper
        1. EQ
            1. Parametric ReaEQ to eliminate hissing and resonance
            2. Low pass filters to remove snare buzzing
        2. ReaFIR to eliminate noise
        3. Adding reverb with ReaVerbate to "brighten" or add depth to track
        4. Eliminate peaking/clipping using Kenny Goaia's split fade trick
        4. Add effects with envelopes (playrate, volume)
            1. Add FX to individual items (helmet effect)
    6. Can compare single tracks to joined tracks to show benefit of
