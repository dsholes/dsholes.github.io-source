<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
I scaled and optimized the design of a low-emission, natural draft gas burner, developed at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The burner ([patent pending](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20180224120A1/en?inventor=darren+sholes&oq=darren+sholes)) can be used in small scale thermal power applications, such as residential appliances. See the report on design and development [here](https://eta.lbl.gov/sites/all/files/publications/lbnl-1006345.pdf).
