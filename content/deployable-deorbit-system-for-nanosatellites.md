<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
I designed a de-orbit system for small satellites to address the growing space debris problem in the Low Earth Orbit regime.  It is a passive deployable dragsail, to be triggered at the end of a satellite's mission. A prototype (NABEO), developed in collaboration with HPS GmbH, was launched on RocketLab's It's Business Time first commercial rocket. The next iteration, LOKI, is currently undergoing qualification, and will be tested onboard ERNST, a 12U nanosatellite, expected to launch in 2021.

I published a [conference paper]({static}pdfs/14G02_sholes_deorbit.pdf) and presented results related to the design and development.
