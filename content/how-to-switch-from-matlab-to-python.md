Look, I get it. You already know Matlab. All your s@#%'s already written in Matlab. Your company, your lab, or your school is already paying for Matlab. It feels comfortable. It feels easy.

But let's be honest. You don't *really* like it. It doesn't bring you joy. You use it because it's what you learned in school, because your company pays for it, because it's been convenient, because you didn't know there was an alternative.

There are many alternatives. Many **free** alternatives. As in $0 forever. And I could spend a few minutes compiling a list of reasons why you should pick Python. But you're already reading this post, so I'll assume I don't have to do that. Some will argue that if you're going to invest time learning a new language, it should be C++, or Go, or Julia or blah blah blah, but for some reason you feel drawn to Python. Go with your gut.

What you need is some help getting started. You want to switch. You need to switch. But it feels really overwhelming.
