<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
I developed a feature detection tool with Python OpenCV to analyze Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) data of a low-emission, fuel flexible gas burner. The tool was used to detect different features of the flame brush in order to characterize a scaled version of the Low-Swirl Burner, developed at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. See the source code [here](https://github.com/dsholes/python-piv).
