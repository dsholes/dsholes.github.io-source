<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
I built a slightly modified version of the [Little Gem](https://www.electrosmash.com/little-gem-analysis) pocket amp to bring with me when I moved from California to Germany. I wanted something portable to use with headphones while I settled into a new home. The case is an old Altoid's container, to keep my riffs minty fresh.
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

The only knobs are for Volume and Gain, to add a bit of crunch.
