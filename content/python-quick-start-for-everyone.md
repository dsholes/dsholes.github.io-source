If you're here, then I probably don't need to convince you to learn Python. It's powerful, it's flexible, it's open source and free (as in $0), and there are thousands of resources available on the interwebs for learning it.

If you've been wanting to learn how to program, or need something more powerful than Excel, or something that's not Matlab ([see here](link how to switch from python to matlab)), then Python's probably a good choice.

If you're an engineer, scientist, or researcher who regularly uses Excel to do something math related, then you should probably switch to Python.

If you're not a software engineer, or computer scientist, and you're trying to learn your first programming language, you should probably learn Python.

If you've ever used formulas in Excel, written a script of any kind, or can grasp the most basic concepts from Algebra, then you can learn Python.

This guide is meant to help you start from ground zero. Like, how the @#$% do I install Python on my computer, ground zero.

I will try to keep it to the bare essentials, so that you can start doing something useful in as little time as possible. The hope is that you feel empowered to use Python to make your work/life easier.

You can learn this. It's not hard. It's like learning anything else. You are a completely capable, wonderful human. If you get stuck, Google is your best friend, followed by Stackoverflow.
