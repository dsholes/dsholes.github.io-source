This is aimed at researchers looking to move away from Excel. Eventually I'll post a series on Python for data analysis, but this is just to get your feet wet.

- Create new conda environment with just python 3.7 (e.g. `data`)
- Install ipykernel in that new environment
- Install pandas in new `data` environment
