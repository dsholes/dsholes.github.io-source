<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
I co-developed a methodology for estimating U.S. manufacturing water use at various spatial and sectoral resolutions. I wrote the code to perform the data analysis using `pandas` and used a combination of `plotly` and custom plotting tools to create interactive visualizations. The results [were published in *Environmental Science and Technology*](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.8b04896), an American Chemical Society publication.
