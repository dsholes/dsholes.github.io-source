I'm a human. I'm also a musician (FKKosmonauts), homebrewer (Liver Breakers Kollectiv), cook, engineer, scientist, and Pythonista.

I'm from California, but in 2017 my partner and I exchanged the best weather in the U.S. for the best weather in Germany (where it only *occasionally* snows in May). I'm currently living and working in Freiburg im Breisgau, a beautiful city in the heart of the Black Forest.

When I'm not <s>making a mess</s> in the lab, you will find me cooking / jamming / laughing with friends, playing basketball, walking around in a forest, or sleeping.

My [Notebook](https://dsholes.github.io/notebook) will (hopefully) serve as my external memory, the things I want to keep organized for the future: projects, recipes, things I've learned, and things I'm likely to forget. Maybe you'll find some of those things useful.

For a quick summary of my professional self, see my [CV](https://dsholes.github.io/pdfs/DarrenSholesCV.pdf).
