At this point you have correctly installed Python on your computer using the Miniconda distribution. You're ready to run some Python code.

If you've programmed before, you may want to skip this and go straight to [Writing your first Python program](link). If you're just curious what python code looks like, the read below.

The most basic way to write/run python code is using the python interpreter directly from Terminal/Command Prompt.

1. Open Terminal/Command Prompt
    1. Link to Intro to Terminal/Command Prompt. Don't Fear the Terminal
2. type `python`, to start the python interpreter
    1. Your terminal should now look something like this:

3. type `x = 1` and hit enter
    1. You've just run your first python code!! Pretty anti-climactic, huh? It may seem like nothing happened. What you've done is created a variable `x` and stored the integer `1` in that variable.
4. type `y = 2` and hit enter
5. type `z = x + y` and hit enter
    1. As I said in the intro article, if you understand basic algebraic concepts, then you can learn python. If `x = 1` and `y = 2`, what does `z` equal?
6. To see what `z` is now storing, type `print(z)` and hit enter. Alternatively, you can just type `z` and hit enter. Your terminal should now look like this:

You've run your first python code! See, not so scary. One thing you may notice is there's no way to save the code that you've just written.

In the next post, we'll cover a more realistic/useful way to write, save and execute python code.
